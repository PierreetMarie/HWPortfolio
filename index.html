            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>My name is Enrique Sandino and I was born in Nicaragua. Nicaragua is located in Central America and it is a country
                with no more than 7 million habitants. I studied in a private school and I was able to learn English and French there.
                I consider myself a person that enjoys playing sports. In highschool I was captain of the soccer team and eventually
                I worked myself up to play in Division I for soccer. </p>
            <p> My highschool was really artsy and I learned how to play the guitar and the violin. During my highschool days my friends
                and I form a band and started playing in different concerts. Sadly my best friends ended up moving to different countries
                and the band broke up. </p>
